Before rewriting history, it’s smart to check whether any .env files are actually committed in your repo history.

1. Check if .env is currently tracked
```git ls-files | grep .env```


- If this prints .env, then it’s currently tracked in your repo.

2. Search the entire git history for .env
```git log --all -- .env```

- If you see commits listed, that means .env has been committed at some point in history.

3. Grep for .env in the history

- This checks commit messages and file paths:

```git log --stat | grep .env```

4. Scan all commits for the word .env
```git rev-list --objects --all | grep .env```

- This is the most thorough — it’ll show every commit and object where .env appeared.

ProTip: use ``git show <hash commit>`` to reveal the secret in plain text
